# hide
hide from them

This program takes an input text (or reads from a file) and hides it in the last two bits of every byte of an image. The image of a banana,
called "hide.png" (the image, not the banana) has written in it the entire Divine Comedy, by Dante Alighieri. If I remember well, it took my
computer, a Thinkpad x250, between 2 and 4 hours to do it.
